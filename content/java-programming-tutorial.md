## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, allowing developers to write code that can run on any device that supports Java.

## Setting Up the Environment

To start programming in Java, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install JDK**: Visit the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) to download the Java Development Kit (JDK).
2. **Set Up IDE**: You can use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Download and install your preferred IDE.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open your command line and type `java -version` to check if Java is installed correctly.

## Basic Syntax

Java syntax is similar to C++. Hereâ€™s a simple Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
